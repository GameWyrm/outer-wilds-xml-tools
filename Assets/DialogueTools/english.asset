    LANGUAGE FOUND IN DATABASE

    CONFIGURING ON-BOARD
    MEMORY STONES...DONE'
  - Welcome, [HEARTHIAN]! Whether you are here seeking a new life, or have simply
    come to visit out of curiosity, the Magister welcomes you to our humble community!
  - 'ERROR: ATTEMPT TO CONTACT MAGISTER FAILED (NULL REFERENCE EXCEPTION: FIELD "MAGISTER"
    NOT SET TO AN INSTANCE OF AN OBJECT), MANUAL FALLBACK REQUESTED.'
  - Please head inside and request from anyone to be directed to the Magister, they
    will be happy to assist.
  - 'WARNING: Hatch insecure! Hatch mode set to MANUAL.

    Reason: "To allow others
    to follow"'
  - 'Remaining oxygen leaking out! Recommendation: Secure hatch immediately. Controls
    in Magister''s room.'
  - 'VULTOS: The Device is nearly ready, Magister.'
  - 'MAGISTER: Good, good. A project millions of years in the making will finally
    see its conclusion.'
  - 'QUARTZ: When that geyser launched me into the stratosphere, I never would have
    reckoned it would be the start of something so...big.'
  - 'LILY: I don''t think any of us had anticipated that the Magister''s message
    would so completely change our lives.'
  - 'ROJA: It is certainly a strange feeling. I had no doubts in our Magister''s
    ability, but it feels strange to know zat zis will all be over soon.'
  - 'VESPA: To travel new worlds, new universes, I have to admit, I am a little nervous
    about the whole prospect.'
  - 'ACQUARIUS: Aye, the feeling''s understandable, mate. The unknown is...scary.
    But exploring the unknown is what yer good at. You''ll do great out there.'
  - 'MAGISTER: The Device passes inspection. Vultos, turn it on. Once it''s ready...follow
    me onto the platform.'
  - 'NO ENTRY!

    This room has been sealed away due to the horrors contained within.

    Make
    no attempt to enter without the Magister''s express permission.'
  - To roast marshmallows, that friendship around a campfire may never end.
  - 'MAGISTER: Acquarius, are you all right?'
  - 'ACQUARIUS: Yeah, I''m fine, I''ve had far worse shocks. Shoulda turned the breaker
    off first, but I couldn''t find it.'
  - 'MAGISTER: Oh, there is no breaker. Here. There, the power should be off.'
  - 'MAGISTER: Please, do not hesitate to ask me to turn off the power for you. I
    do not mind.'
  - 'ACQUARIUS: ''preciate it, boss, but I was more worried about disruptin'' the
    others.'
  - 'ROJA: ACQUARIUS, DID YOU BREAK ZE LIGHTING? It''s hard enough for me to paint
    normally!'
  - 'ACQUARIUS: ...case in point.'
  - 'ACQUARIUS: ...and that''s the last battery charged, including the spares.'
  - 'LILY: What are the spares for?'
  - 'ACQUARIUS: Boss wants me to put some extras in my room in case someone else
    comes and wants to follow us.'
  - 'LILY: Actually, I have been wondering: After we step into the Device with our
    batteries in hand, we''re not going to be able to come back. Who is going to
    turn the Device off?'
  - 'ACQUARIUS: Oh, it won''t be shut off. It''s a little too complicated to just
    turn it back on, so others who want to follow just need to read the mem''ry cubes
    and head into the Device with one of the spare batteries.'
  - 'LILY: But won''t that drain all the power? The Device certainly won''t function
    without energy.'
  - 'ACQUARIUS: Don''t worry, Boss says the reserve power should last right up until
    the sun goes Supernova.'
  - 'LILY: Well, what about this room? Certainly all the power draw is going to cause
    a lot of stress on the ship. How will we know if the ship even survives until
    then?'
  - 'ACQUARIUS: ...'
  - 'ACQUARIUS: I''m sure it''ll be <![CDATA[<i>fiiiiine</i>]]>.'
  - Welcome to my Grand Archives. Over the thousands of millenia I have explored
    the cosmos, I have hoarded the knowledge of many civilizations and recorded all
    of it here in this library.
  - Unless you are also 20 feet tall, please do not attempt to take any books from
    the larger shelves. For books you can safely hold, please ask Vultos for assistance
    with getting a translated copy in your language.
  - 'VESPA: Roja, how do you do it?'
  - 'ROJA: Oh, lots of practice, yes.'
  - 'VESPA: Well, all the practice in the world won''t help with your...'
  - 'ROJA: Colorblindness? True, only being able to see ze world in various shades
    of red does make it difficult to paint, but it helps to do more abstract art
    like zis. Details become less important.'
  - 'VESPA: True, I have noticed you don''t really paint landscape scenes like is
    common among my kind.'
  - 'ROJA: Ah, yes, I vould love to see some of your culture''s arts! I vonder vat
    kind of secrets you would hide in zem.'
  - 'VESPA: Well, it''s not unheard of to hide secrets behind paintings, but that
    has never been an interest of mine, personally. Do you like hiding secrets in
    your paintings?'
  - 'ROJA: ...well, zat is a secret, now, isn''t it?'
  - 'NOTICE: Access to the Reading Room is restricted while overdue books are taken
    out and unaccounted for. Please bring the books to this table and they will be
    returned shortly.'
  - 'As of the last scan (2 hours ago), there are three missing books:'
  - 'SECRET LEGENDS: A Hero''s Guide to Deciphering the Undecipherable, by Skip.
    Detected in: Dormatory, Vultos'' room.'
  - 'THE COORDINATES CRASH, by Ixrecius. Detected in: Campfire Room'
  - 'THE ASTEROID ARCADE, by Sir Zen Quobois XLII. Detected in: Library, above intended
    reading space. CAUTION: There is no architecture leading to the estimated location,
    exercise caution if you intend to seek it out.'
  - 'MAGISTER: Vultos, it does please me that you are just as interested in the secrets
    of the universe as I am.'
  - 'VULTOS: Hmm? Oh, yeah, sure.'
  - 'MAGISTER: Vultos, are you all right? You know you can always talk to me.'
  - 'VULTOS: Oh, um, sure, thanks.'
  - 'MAGISTER: Vultos, do you still blame yourself?'
  - 'VULTOS: Look, I told you already, I''m not... I''m not ready to discuss that.'
  - 'MAGISTER: May I ask when you will be ready?'
  - 'VULTOS: Let''s just focus on the Device. I''ve got a schematic written up, but
    I think I''ve hit a problem. The Device will have difficulty actually affecting
    someone with space protection.'
  - 'MAGISTER: Oh, Vultos, I suppose I was unclear. While it will take us out there,
    we will be in a state where we do not need such protection. No clothing will
    be needed, though if I am reading this right, a thin layer of clothes should
    still work fine.'
  - 'VULTOS: Hmm, yes, of course. I''ll make sure to set the Device so that it doesn''t
    even try to fire if you are wearing too much for it.'
  - 'ROJA: Lamp. Lamp. Lamp. Lamp. Lamp.'
  - 'VULTOS: AH! Roja! This is supposed to be my secret spot!'
  - 'VULTOS: ...are you...hypnotized?'
  - 'VULTOS: ...moths are <![CDATA[<i>weird</i>]]>.'
  - 'QUARTZ: You know, forgive me if this is a bit of an inappropriate question,
    but, well, do any of you guys know what the Magister, well, looks like?'
  - 'ACQUARIUS: Admittedly, I''ve often wondered the same thing. Boss never leaves
    ''is room without ''is mask and robe, unless he''s disguised.'
  - 'VULTOS: I''ve always just assumed he was some kind of cosmic horror, to be honest.'
  - 'LILY: Hypothesis: what we see is not even his true form, but he has taken it
    because it is something we can comprehend.'
  - 'VESPA: Perhaps he believes we will find his appearance frightening.'
  - 'ROJA: Yes, I''ve seen it...you do not vant to...I still have not recovered.'
  - 'VESPA: You saw his true self, dear? Oh, no, come here, we didn''t mean to stress
    you out.'
  - 'VULTOS: ...cosmic horror it is, I guess.'
  - ...as my travels took me to a librarian above a great atoll, we had a great trivia
    battle, and he was impressed with my knowledge. "How do you know what an owl
    is, or an elk? You come from an alien land!" I informed him of my status as the
    Magister, and began to tell him of the knowledge that I have acquired from across
    the cosmos, fauna and flora that you've never seen...
  - ...The Ditzian Shark is an acquatic predator that makes its home in the waters
    of the massive ocean planet of Subroara. It has been responsible for the extinction
    of multiple bird species...
  - ...Red-backed Boarnods, or Ruby Elks, are an aggressive antlered species home
    to the Koriander System. They like to hunt down the planet's Hunter Owls...
  - ...The Kipkip Carrot is a common meal among the planet's tiny inhabitants. It
    is often served with pods from the Etherbud plant. Despite being called a carrot,
    it tastes more like the Clapping Potato found in the Caveson System...
  - ...The Green-backed Bukrad is the largest bukrad species in the known universe,
    with a long body with fifty pairs of legs. It is so large, it has been reported
    to hunt Nomai, though its primary prey is the Mustached Star-Jackal, itself known
    for being able to hide from most other predators by turning invisible...
  - '[The cube keeps going on with facts you''re sure are fascinating, but you have
    more important things to be worrying about. As you step away, it starts to loop.]'
  - 'VULTOS: Well, it seems that campfires are a constant of the universe.'
  - 'QUARTZ: You sure it''s ok for me to set one up in here?'
  - 'VESPA: Don''t worry, I set up filters for the smoke. Indoor fires are a common
    thing for my kind.'
  - 'ACQUARIUS: ''Aight, lemme see these "marshmallows" you keep raving about.'
  - 'QUARTZ: Of course! Here, you can eat one raw...yes, I know, their gooey flavor
    is the best thing in the universe. But watch this, you put it on a stick, roast
    it on the fire for a minute, and...

    even better, a roasted marshmallow!'
  - 'ROJA: Mmm, delicious!'
  - 'MAGISTER: Yes, quite, the flavor is...something. But I believe it''s incomplete...'
  - 'QUARTZ: What? You dare insult the Hearthian Magnum Opus?'
  - 'MAGISTER: Oh, I would not dream of it. It has quite a flavor, even on its own.
    But, perhaps with the several of us here, the flavor can be enhanced. Lily, do
    you have any of those honey crackers?'
  - 'LILY: Of course, Magister! Here, I have a pack right now.'
  - 'MAGISTER: Wonderful! And Acquarius, do you have any chocolate?'
  - 'ACQUARIUS: Salted or unsalted? I got ''em both.'
  - 'MAGISTER: I''d like to try with the unsalted first. Break off a square, put
    it a cracker, then stick on a perfectly roasted marshmallow to melt it, and...top
    it with another cracker. Down the hatch...it is delicious!'
  - 'ACQUARIUS: ''ere, lemme try, MMMMMM!'
  - 'QUARTZ: Huh, had my doubts, but you''re right, this is so good!'
  - 'VULTOS: Here is my room. It''s not much, but our kind do have a thing for minimalism.'
  - 'QUARTZ: Ah, it''s quite nice. You know, we don''t really need much either. Just
    some boards, connected with sap and duct tape.'
  - 'VULTOS: It must be nice, such a simple life. Sleeping under the stars, eating
    marshmallows, and taking each day one at a time without a care in the world.'
  - 'QUARTZ: Yeah, but can''t say I''m not looking forward to something brand new,
    even if it is a lot more complex.'
  - 'QUARTZ: By the way, what''s your story, Vultos? You''ve been here the longest,
    right?'
  - 'VULTOS: Well, not quite: the Magister was here first. No one really knows his
    story. But, he did find me and rescue me. My escape pod landed on an uninhabited
    planet, and I lacked the skills for survival. I would have died, if he hadn''t
    found me and brought me on board.'
  - 'QUARTZ: And it was then he presented you the idea for the Device, right? I admit,
    I still find the whole idea a little weird.'
  - 'VULTOS: It''s understandable to doubt our goal here. But it''s for the good
    of all. We must ensure this universe does not truly die.'
  - 'VULTOS: It''s really been 200 years since that day, huh. 200 years since...I
    ran like a coward.'
  - 'VULTOS: The Magister and Vespa always try to console me, and I know they''re
    right. Had I stayed, I''d have died with the rest of them.'
  - 'VULTOS: Still, that doesn''t make it hurt any less. The idea that...I didn''t
    deserve to be rescued. I should have died on that green planet, fallen into one
    of the geysers and drowned.'
  - 'VULTOS: I hope that...'
  - 'VULTOS: I should get back to work on my schematics.'
  - 'VESPA: And that''s four games in a row. Best five out of nine?'
  - 'VULTOS: Ha, you bet! I''ll win one of these days!'
  - 'ACQUARIUS: Methinks maybe ya should give up, you haven''t won a game in nearly
    two hundred years!'
  - 'VESPA: Quitters never prosper, Acquarius.'
  - 'ACQUARIUS: Back where I come from, ''tis considered wisdom to know when to stop.
    I''d have shocked myself to death long ago if I simply kept banging me head against
    me problems. Vul, ''ow about taking a break, ya? I know yer in a hurry to win,
    but patience is a virtue.'
  - 'VESPA: Are you alright? I''ve never used a Vision Torch on another race...'
  - 'MAGISTER: No, I, I am all right. This technology is quite unique. Projection
    is a key function the Device needs.'
  - 'VESPA: Would you like to try it? Here, you should be able to use the Torch...'
  - 'MAGISTER: No, thank you, I''ve gathered all the data I need from it already.'
  - 'VESPA: ...all right.'
  - 'VESPA: What goes on in that mind? Who <![CDATA[<i>are</i>]]> you?'
  - 'QUARTZ: Wow, I''ve seen Nomai stuff before, but never so...fresh and clean.'
  - 'LILY: You''ve met Nomai before?'
  - 'QUARTZ: I wish, but all the Nomai my kind have found have died long ago. There
    are plenty of ruins of theirs, but we have no idea what happened to them. Their
    buildings are all abandoned.'
  - 'LILY: ...oh.'
  - 'QUARTZ: Oh, sorry, I, I didn''t think about it. I mean, I''m sure there are
    more Nomai out there...'
  - 'LILY: Oh, no, don''t let me be a downer! Come on, you still have many others
    to meet! And we still need to determine what technology you can contribute to
    the Device.'
  - 'QUARTZ: Yeah, of course!'
  - 'ROJA: *soothing humming*'
  - 'VULTOS: This is quite a garden you''ve got here. I guess you have a lot of experience
    with plants?'
  - 'ROJA: Oh! I did not see you zere! Yes, I am a master gardener. It vas my main
    hobby back home, and quite a valuable profession.'
  - 'VULTOS: Oh, really, why is that?'
  - 'ROJA: Oh, vell you see, my kind has extremely limited color vision. Many colors
    you can distinguish appear identical to us. As ve are an herbivorous species,
    being able to determine vat a plant vas vis our far more limited ability to really
    see zem vas an invaluable skill.'
  - 'VULTOS: I see. Well, I''m glad you have a hobby you enjoy so much, and you''re
    able to be a big help to your kind.'
  - 'ROJA: Sank you for ze kind vords!'
  - 'VULTOS: Brightening up other people''s days is my calling.'
  - 'ROJA: Are you sure it is vise to leave a can of flammable liquid in a room made
    of vood?'
  - 'QUARTZ: Hmm? Why wouldn''t it be? I''ll be careful.'
  - 'ROJA: Yes, just like you vere careful to not fall in zat geyser.'
  - 'QUARTZ: Well, it turned out all right, didn''t it? Had I not, I''d never have
    met you guys!'
  - 'ROJA: Zat is true.... Just promise me zat you von''t cause a fire. I''d hate
    for something to happen to you, or my plants next door.'
  - 'QUARTZ: Of course! I shall do my best to ensure this is maintained responsibly.'
  - 'ROJA: Sank you. By the vay, vy do you even have it?'
  - 'QUARTZ: It''s a special blend of flammable tree sap. I figure if there''s anything
    I can contribute to the Device, it''s the Hearthian special fuel.'
  - 'The Magister is not in right now. Entrance to his quarters is currently denied.
    Please come back later, the Magister will return in: 999,999 YEARS.'
  - I found this figure at a gift shop in some forgotten land. There were several
    versions of this character in various configurations, and almost all of them
    looked...adorable.
  - But this one, this one...something about it just...fills me with a sense of ANGER
    and MALICE. As if...the only thing I want when I look at it is to BAN it from
    existence.
  - Perhaps it was unwise to obtain something that affects me so negatively, but
    I am just so...intrigued by it.
  - I woke up in this mysterious vessel.... I do not know who I am...what I am...or
    why I am here.
  - 'What I do know: this ship is mine, it responds to my desires, and I have a myriad
    of these strange cubes that appear to record memories and play them at will...'
  - And...I do not believe I have amnesia. I was...created here. This ship, created
    for me. But by whom?
  - Well, there is a whole universe out there for me to explore.... The answer must
    be out there somewhere.
  - Today I found something...universe-shaking. A vortex, a power older than the
    universe, and I feel some...kinship, with it.
  - 'I spoke with it, and it did not have any answers for me. It simply told me its
    purpose: to end all, that all might be born anew. Despite the tone some might
    interpret as sinister, it bears no ill will. Like...a decomposer, it serves a
    critical role in recycling death, so that more life may rise from the dead.'
  - But, must all end? True, this universe has a limited lifespan, but what if, what
    if we were not bound by this universe?
  - The idea that all must end...that is the Lie of the Universe.... There must be
    a way to preserve the life of this universe beyond.
  - As I was making my centennial trip to the vortex to see if there had been any
    new developments, I received a distress signal from a nearby planet. A young
    creature had been stranded there in his escape pod, and with his lack of survival
    skills, he would have surely died of starvation, or worse.
  - I rescued him, of course, but when I asked him where his home was so I could
    take him back, he said he had none. His kind had killed themselves off in a war,
    and he was the sole survivor of his race. His own planet was no longer even fit
    to live on. With that, he broke down sobbing.
  - When he recovered, I offered him board, in return for his assistance. I had a
    plan to counter the Lie, and for that I would need to build a Device. However,
    this Device was based on connections, on community, and in order for it to function,
    I would need the collaboration of many others.
  - Without hesitation, he agreed. I created a room for him, and we exchanged more
    information about each other. His name is Vultos. And my name is...my name...I...I
    told him that I am the Magister.
  - I have encountered a major problem. I am immortal, and while the idea that a
    being would have a limited lifespan is a known fact to me, it has just not occurred
    to me just how short a life is.
  - Vultos is aging quite rapidly, and while he has been an invaluable asset in the
    creation of the Device, he will not live nearly long enough to see it be fired.
  - Fortunately, I have a solution. An Immortality Crystal, installed as part of
    the Device, and completely preventing aging. It will not work for our ultimate
    goal, but it should allow anyone on this ship to survive long enough to see the
    day it is reached.
  - I passed by an inhabited moon, and in disguise I visited the population in search
    of someone who would be willing to work on the Device. The beings here are bird-like,
    with antlers.
  - I was recommended the house of one of them, who was a young inventor, Vespa.
    She had created a telescope powered by flame, capable of detecting signals from
    space.
  - It took some convincing, as she was understandably quite scared of the idea,
    but when I turned to leave, she changed her mind. It seemed that her fear of
    the unknown was overcome by her desire to see the cosmos she had studied all
    her life.
  - On the ship, we talked about her and her kind. The name for their race roughly
    translates to "Inhabitants", but Vultos, spooked by her when she first arrived,
    wanted to call her "Ghost Bird". She's not really a fan of the nickname, though.
    Considering that she seems to share traits with both owls and elks, I've presented
    the idea O-[REMAINING RECORDING CORRUPTED]
  - Today we crashed into an ocean planet. There was a malfunction with the engines,
    and the ship was unable to counter the massive gravity when we tried to park.
  - Fortunately, this planet is occupied by a friendly race of semiaquatic four-armed
    shark people, and one of them was kind enough to come aboard and try to fix the
    engines.
  - He's an electrical engineer named Acquarius, and he's quite friendly despite
    how intimidating poor old Vultos finds him. He's even taller than Vespa, though
    of course nowhere near my true stature.
  - He was absolutely fascinated by all of the equipment on our ship, and he actually
    asked to join our crew. Well, welcome aboard!
  - I came across yet another escape pod today, this one Nomaian in origin. Despite
    the massive capacity, there was only one member on board, by the name of Lily.
  - Like Vespa, she was an inventor, and she had created a Warp Core Anti-Distortion
    Safeguard. This component, meant to be equipped to their Vessels, would essentially
    "ping" the area a Vessel is attempting to warp to and check for distorted space.
    If such space were found, it would modify the warp coordinates slightly to prevent
    a potential disaster.
  - She planned to present this at a Festival, but her clan laughed at the idea.
    Distorted space was an unproven concept, and the component was quite expensive
    to create. In a fit of anger, she used an Escape Pod in an attempt to get as
    far from her clan as possible.
  - I, however, was very interested in her tech and theories, and welcomed her aboard.
  - 'Roja: botanist and painter. Why did I let her on board?'
  - Do not get me wrong, I am happy to have a new member on our crew, but she is
    so...mischevious. I fear that she is one day going to poke around in this ship
    where she does not belong.
  - Sigh...I am sure she will calm herself in time.
  - Our deadline approaches. The Device is nearly complete, but we need one more
    component. I went to visit the vortex again, but on a nearby planet, I caught
    sight of a local Hearthian who had accidentally launched themself into space
    via a geyser.
  - They haven't even discovered space flight yet, but...well, I need help. Maybe
    this one, named Quartz, will provide the last component we need.

  - the Magister
  - ...
  - Who are you?
  - Where are we?
  - Welcome to the Outer Planes, young one, the void beyond the Wilds. I am the Magister,
    the one who set this all in motion.
  - You have joined us in a state that is not quite physical, in a space that is
    not quite in this universe. You still have some of your physical consciousness
    left, so you are unable to see what this place truly looks like quite yet; however,
    we can now finally communicate.
  - What questions might you have for me?
  - Why did you do this?
  - What have you found here?
  - What's with all the cubes?
  - Can I enter that room behind the big door in the Grand Chamber?
  - What happens now?
  - Goodbye.
  - I am an entity millions, if not billions, of years old. I have powers and knowledge
    beyond your comprehension. I have a vessel that responds to my every whim, even
    modifying its shape to be whatever I wanted. But, why?
  - I do not know where I come from. I know I was created, but I do not know who
    created me. I had hypothesized that whoever they were, they were not of this
    universe. I began to come up with an idea for a Device that would allow me to
    ascend beyond this universe, but my attempts and ideas went nowhere. I eventually
    gave up.
  - But then...I discovered the mortality of this universe. The idea that it had
    to end.
  - But I rejected that idea. Surely it was a lie.
  - I realized that I wanted to defy that lie. I wanted to preserve the life in this
    universe, by any means necessary. To that end, I revisited the idea of the Device.
    I was not powerful enough to stop the stars themselves from dying, but I could
    perhaps take at least a few people with me who did not mind the concept of surfing
    the unknown for eternity.
  - And then, as I began to recruit people to help build the Device, this common
    goal began to take shape. I began to suspect my purpose was perhaps to build
    a community here, and as people joined us, I had more ideas about how to construct
    the Device.
  - Finally, after seven of us had gathered, all from different backgrounds and time
    periods, we had everything we needed, and the Device was finished. I left it
    on, so that others interested could follow if they wished. Although, in my haste
    to finally ascend, I seem to have made some mistakes and did not properly prepare
    my vessel for foreign visitors. I apologize for making your journey more difficult
    than intended.
  - Sure, if you think your mind can withstand the horrors within. You shall find
    the door gone on your next loop.
  - Just, one question, do you like spiders?
  - I like them!
  - They're terrifying!
  - All right, then you should be fine.
  - I see. Do not worry then.
  - I have not found my creators. But, I have been able to see beyond...I have seen
    other worlds, other universes, other realities.
  - I saw you.
  - I am unsure whether they actually were you, or other versions of you, but I saw
    you, exploring other worlds, other realities.
  - You saw a solar neighborhood. You visited medleys of planets. You survived an
    alien incursion. You shared a vision.
  - You went on a quest to find a banjo. You were stalked in your dreams. You explored
    the surface of Dark Bramble and found a Friend. You discovered an ancient codec.
  - These realities moved like clockwork, in mysterious layers. Worlds were bigger
    on the inside, and hidden in plain sight.
  - But then...then I looked beyond. I saw strange creatures. Beings beyond any of
    these realities. Close, I saw a dragon, a shoe, a Hearthian in Nomai clothes,
    a turtle, and some pink puffball.
  - Further, there were more. A cow, a rock, a nebula, a Canadian, a fox, more turtles,
    a three-eyed cat, and many more. They seem to be a...community of their own.
    I began to suspect that these individuals were the creators of these realities.
    Perhaps even...my creators.
  - And then, I realized, they had already done what I wanted. They had subverted
    the lie. This universe indeed did not have to truly end, and they were responsible.
  - In the end, was my desire simply their desire? To contribute to increasing the
    lifespan of this universe?
  - If so, then I am glad to have served my purpose, and I am thankful to you for
    being their avatar.
  - And to these beings, if they can hear me, thank you.
  - I know that, truly, the lie will eventually become true. One will explore the
    Wilds for the final time, and the vortex will have the last laugh. But, it is
    because of you that this ending does not have to happen now.
  - As for you, young hatchling, all will be clear to you soon, after your physical
    form has fully dissolved into the void. However, your connection to the time
    loop depends on this physical consciousness, so anything you wish to do that
    you wish to remember, you should do now.
  - When you are ready to ascend with us, enter the shape below where you entered
    here.
  - Vultos
  - Hello. It has been a long time since I met someone with your curiosity.
  - Tell me, how does it feel to know the survival of your race hangs on your shoulders?
  - It's not easy. I shouldn't have to make that kind of decision.
  - I've come to accept it.
  - I understand. I have lived with regret ever since...that day, and I do not know
    if I made the correct decision. But, I cannot imagine what it must be like to
    be perpetually stuck in a position where you must make that decision.
  - I am glad to hear that. I hope that you do not end up regretting your decision.
    I have lived with regret ever since...that day.
  - You are the one who was in that escape pod I found on Timber Hearth, aren't you?
  - What is your regret?
  - Ah, yes, you visited my homeworld. You saw how my kind destroyed themselves over
    petty arguments.
  - I happened to be awake when the Red Clan invaded. We were all supposed to be
    in cryo-pods during transit, but I snuck out.
  - When they came, I rushed to the Escape Pods, and without even thinking of trying
    to save anyone else, I just launched the pod. Through some miracle, the pod managed
    to survive long enough to reach your world.
  - Not a day goes by that I don't wonder if I made the correct decision. I feel
    like I should have tried to save some others, but if I had, then there is a good
    chance no one would have survived.
  - Do not live with regret. It consumes you. I only got through it because of my
    friends. Never forget those who have brought you this far.
  - In short, I made a choice to save myself, but that choice may have prevented
    any others from being saved.
  - Vespa
  - Greetings. Do not fear. The unknown is scary, but beautiful.
  - I wish my race had maintained their curiosity like you, but in the end, they
    let their fear take over, and fear became hate.
  - But your curiosity, it is a wonderful thing. Never stop exploring.
  - Acquarius
  - Aye. If we were still corporial, I'd put you through a workout. You're a twig!
  - But, yer smart. You managed ta get all the way here. You'll do fine.
  - Also, ya really need ta invent chocolate. You're missing out.
  - Lily
  - Greetings. I am Lily. I am Nomai, but you already knew all that.
  - I do not know whether to envy you. You are potentially the ultimate explorer.
    You can explore anywhere without fear of consequence and death.
  - Yet, you are also unable to truly share your discoveries. Anything you learn
    will be forgotten in minutes.
  - To explore, and share our discoveries, that is the goal of the Nomai. It is why
    we became nomads in the first place.
  - Roja
  - Hiiiiii! I like your flashlight. I am so glad zat in zis state, I can see you
    in full color!
  - I hope you liked the art and plants. I tried very hard to make them look good.
  - Oh, perhaps I can see you paint later? I'd love to be your friend.
  - Quartz
  - Hey hatchling! Pull up a marshmallow stick!
  - Well, we'll have time to roast marshmallows again later. How is the village doing?
  - We went to space!
  - Really? Every Hearthian's dream to explore the Outer Wilds, it finally came true?
  - Yep! Hornfels, Feldspar, Gossan, Esker, and Slate founded Outer Wilds Ventures,
    a space program, and we've been exploring the stars ever since.
  - Ah, I know those names! They were only little hatchlings when I left. I'm glad
    to see they grew up into such fine Hearthians. And you! You're following in their
    footsteps! I am so happy to see our legacy continue.
  - Oh, and if you meet another Quartz, say hi to them from their ancestor. Name
    runs in the family!
  - 'LILY: Well... I''m here, it seems. The "Magister" invited me here; let''s see
    if he''s as cordial as his invitation.'
  - 'LILY: This technology is quite advanced. The cube here that greeted me decoded
    my language when I arrived. Perhaps it read from my memory?'
  - 'LILY: Hopefully, my talents will actually be appreciated here.'
  - 'LILY: To preserve advancement, that the next generation may not suffer from
    our mistakes.'
  - 'LILY: It took some searching for resources, but I''ve managed to install a special
    gravity crystal here.'
  - 'LILY: It projects a special kind of gravity field in the whole room, producing
    lighter gravity than this vessel''s average further from it, and heavier gravity
    near it.'
  - 'LILY: And, as is typical for a crystal, it requires no power, so should something
    happen to this vessel''s gravity, we can retreat to this room.'
  - 'LILY: This should be able to satisfy the various gravity requirements for us,
    so we can all relax in comfort together.'
  - 'LILY: We have a new friend today! Her name is Roja.'
  - 'LILY: She''s a botanist, which I find very interesting. The way she sees plants
    must be quite unique. She''s also an artist, and uses some interesting palettes.'
  - 'LILY: The Magister put her room right after mine, so I''m no longer at the end
    of the hallway.'
  - 'LILY: It''s always quite a sight to see the Magister at work, manipulating the
    shape of this Vessel at will.'
  - 'LILY: I''m not usually one to brag, but I must say: my room looks quite a bit
    better than the others!'
  - 'LILY: Only Vespa''s room really even compares, to be honest. The others are
    quite...flat.'
  - 'LILY: I admit, surrounded by familiar architecture, I am beginning to miss home.
    But I know that they probably aren''t missing me. And I''m part of something
    much bigger here, anyway.'
  - 'LILY: Well, having arrived here, I am quite intrigued by the Magister''s proposition.
    To construct the Device, and ensure the memory of this universe survives...'
  - 'LILY: I would love to be able to actually contribute to something important,
    and be appreciated. I''ll be working with four others.'
  - 'LILY: The leader of this vessel is an enigmatic figure who calls himself "The
    Magister." He is quite powerful, able to manipulate this vessel at will, and
    can change his size...and appearance.'
  - 'LILY: Normally, he keeps his appearance to be a tall, cloaked figure, with his
    five glowing eyes visible behind his mask. His size is immense, easily twice
    the size of Acquarius, who himself is about four times my own size.'
  - 'LILY: Despite his immensity, though, he is very friendly and polite. When speaking
    with him, it''s easy to forget the difference in our sizes and not be intimidated.
    I very much enjoy discussing complex topics with him!'
  - 'LILY: The first person to have joined the Magister''s crew is a bibliophile
    named Vultos. He is covered in fur like myself, aside from a hard shell on his
    back and partially running down his forehead, and has a long, bushy tail.'
  - 'LILY: He normally has quite a cheerful demeanor, and I love spending time with
    him. He enjoys playing games with us and cracking jokes, when he''s not hiding
    somewhere absorbed in some volume.'
  - 'LILY: Still, I sense a sadness within him. He has some deep regret, but I am
    reluctant to ask him about it. I am sure the opportunity will arise.'
  - 'LILY: One of my fellow crewmates is a tall, feathered, and antlered individual
    named Vespa. She is also an inventor, much like myself!'
  - 'LILY: She loves seeing the stars, and discussing technology!'
  - 'LILY: The newest member of the crew (before me of course) is a tall, aquatic
    individual named Acquarius.'
  - 'LILY: He''s very mechanically-minded, and likes to work out. He''s quite a strong
    hunk!'
  - 'LILY: He also likes to build little mechanisms, and he''s lined his shelves
    with them, along with his tools.'
  - 'VESPA: ayiuqiojdflkas safsadf-lo4;;;;;adfjajgafsaf455644444444faskjajg  afjasdfpdasec][-'
  - 'LILY: You press the keys like this. It can take some practice to learn how to
    use a writing staff.'
  - 'VESPA: liek That&'
  - 'LILY: Getting closer. Here, try adjusting your typing angle.'
  - 'VESPA: how do i music'
  - 'LILY: One complicated topic at a time, sorry.'
  - 'LILY: I saw Vultos climbing the central pillar once. I''m not quite that athletic,
    but I''m hoping I can see what is up there from here.'
  - 'LILY: He is reading on top of the artificial sun! What does he need that much
    privacy for?'
  - Jam Message...
  - Victory Message...
  - Goodbye
  - GameWyrm, Team Lead
  - Hey it's me, GameWyrm the mundane talking dragon.
  - Congrats on finishing Magistarium! I hope you enjoyed it. I'm GameWyrm, the team
    lead who did all the level design, writing, and coding, as well as some of the
    models.
  - For this mod, I obviously wanted to close out the story of Hearth's Neighbor
    (not neighboUr), but I was originally planning to not use very many custom assets.
    Well, you saw where that went, and I think this mod has even more custom assets
    than HN1!
  - A big component of this mod's design was trying to utilize the time loop, a feature
    I feel is rarely actually implemented even in full length story mods. Our implementation
    may have been simple, but I hope it was effective and memorable!
  - Anyway, thanks so much for playing. This mod was made in 11 days for the Outer
    Wilds 2024 modding jam, where all contestants were challenged to create a single
    planet within the same system. You should definitely check out the other entries
    if you haven't already!
  - Oh, by the way, this room was made pretty early in development, but we had no
    idea what to do with it, so it was cut and repurposed into the dev room. Because
    of that, there's nothing in here, so don't bother going to the end of the hall.
  - Nice, we won! Two in a row!
  - I'm really glad people came to really like Magistarium, even if some of the puzzles
    can still use tweaking.
  - Anyway, there are still a few more things I'd like to do with Magistarium, such
    as voice acting, and who knows, perhaps we'll do more with the Hearth's Neighbor
    story.
  - There probably won't be a Hearth's Neighbor 3, but perhaps you'll get to see
    the Magistarium's crew once again. ::)
  - Shoe, Modeller and Lace Weaver
  - Shoe, Modeller
  - BOOO!!!! Did i get you? I'm Shoe, the Lace Weaver.
  - Hey! I'm Shoe, the modeler for this mod.
  - I just so happened to have grown alot in size compared to the last jam, real
    nice to to be in my true form, hopefully one of you recognize the color scheme
    and get the reference.
  - Aw man, you had to seal my true form away... not truly as ready for the horrors
    within this room as you promised the magister.
  - Anyways it was fun to be working with the same-ish team from last time, although
    I did leave decision making with the rest of the team. Hopes to us winning the
    March 2024 Jam.
  - Also for xen i made 21 models for this mod, ripped one or two, and took a few
    from the past then made 16 models for godot wilds all on time so I was NOT LAZY!!!!!!!!!
  - symbiosis sweep I mean Magistarium sweep as it turns out we placed 1st once again
    yippie!!!
  - Anyways why not stay for a while and enjoy this delicious strawberry jam cake
    I made for this occasion.
  - CelestialsStorm (Quantum Luna), Artist
  - Hello there friend!
  - "Hello! Congrats on finishing! I\u2019m Luna, I made most of the textures and
    concept art for the mod!"
  - "This is the first mod jam I\u2019ve participated in, and the first time I\u2019ve
    contributed to a mod in production. I hope you had just as much fun playing it
    as I did helping to create it!"
  - Thank you for playing!
  - "Wow! I\u2019m so honored to have been on the winning team. It was amazing to
    work with everyone here, I loved every single moment of it!"
  - A huge thank you to Wyrm for letting me join the team, and to the rest of the
    team, I hope we get to work together again come next jam!
  - "Creating assets was a unique challenge, and overall, I\u2019m proud of what
    I managed to contribute!"
  - Once again, thank you for playing, and thank you for voting for us!
  - EndgameZero, Musician
  - Welcome to the dev room! I'm EndgameZero.
  - I'm the composer for Magistarium. (I also edited much of the dialogue.)
  - Overall, I'm pretty happy with this soundtrack. I made fewer songs than in Hearth's
    Neighbor (especially when you consider that a few of the songs are variations
    of the same one), but I think they turned out better individually.
  - This soundtrack took a lot of inspiration from the TUNIC soundtrack, and I referenced
    the Outer Wilds soundtrack less than I did in Hearth's Neighbor. (I will be quite
    impressed if you can figure out the one reference to the Outer Wilds soundtrack
    in the Grand Chamber theme.)
  - Anyway, I decided to be a turtle at the last minute (sorry for any confusion
    with other modding turtles); thanks to Shoe for getting the turtle model done
    on such short notice!
  - Thanks for playing (and listening)!
  - Wow, two for two! If you had told me a year ago that that would happen, I probably
    wouldn't've believed you, especially if you added that I made the music for both.
    For a while, my goal has been to work on games as a programmer, though now I
    might reconsider that, since making music for these mods has gone so well. ::)
  - Once I have time, I plan to make more music for the areas in the Magistarium
    that use music from the base game (or from HN1) in the jam version. If you're
    in the future, you've probably already heard some of it!
  - Hey it's me...
  - Yeah, yeah, yeah, Ernesto the Magic Talking Anglerfish. Don't you guys have any
    more creative Easter Eggs?

  shipLogValues:
  - The Magistarium
  - My ship has received the coordinates of a mysterious vessel above the Solar System
    called the "Magistarium".
  - I found a ship above the Solar System called the Magistarium. It has a hatch
    I can access on one side.
  - Oxygen is leaking out of the Magistarium.
  - The ship's power weakens over time.
  - Near the end of the loop, the ship runs on emergency power and the on-board lights
    turn red.
  - Right before the loop ends, the power in the ship completely dies.
  - Grand Chamber
  - There seems to be a large cavity in the center of the Magistarium.
  - The center of the Magistarium contains a massive chamber that appears to be a
    hub to several rooms.
  - I found a book in a room with a campfire.
  - The Outer Planes
  - The Device
  - In the center of the Grand Chamber is some kind of Device on a platform. The
    Device is surrounded with text in various languages, including Nomai and Hearthian.
  - The Device will not fire if someone on the platform is wearing too much. Thick
    protection, such as a spacesuit, needs to be removed before standing on the platform.
  - The Device requires that the user hold a battery. Spare batteries can be found
    in one of the dormitories.
  - I found controls for the hatch. Air is no longer flowing away from the Device.
  - I managed to make the Device fire.
  - I met the Magister! He and the others who were on the ship decided to warp to
    another plane of existence with the Device in an attempt to preserve the memory
    of the universe and explore the unknown beyond this one.
  - The Magister figured out who his creators might be, and wanted to thank them
    for extending the lifespan of this universe.
  - Library
  - The top floor of the Magistarium is dedicated to a massive library.
  - There is a reading room in the Library that is closed off. Access is denied until
    the overdue books scattered across the ship are returned to a returns table by
    the reading room door.
  - I found a book on top of the artificial sun above the library.
  - One of the ship's inhabitants, Roja, is colorblind, and only able to see the
    world in various shades of red.
  - Roja mentioned that she wondered what kind of secrets others might hide in their
    paintings.
  - There is some kind of ball in the library painting area that shoots light when
    powered. The light makes the paintings in the area look different.
  - Engine Room
  - Power Source
  - The Magistarium's power is fluctuating.
  - The bottom floor seems to contain some kind of engine room or generator. Lethal
    amounts of electricity are leaking from the machines. There is some kind of pedestal
    and a Memory Cube in the middle of the room.
  - The engines do not have any form of breaker to cut off power to the room.
  - Dormitories
  - There is a long hall with a several rooms connected to it. Each room appears
    to belong to a different culture.
  - I found a book on top of a bookcase in the first dorm.
  - One of the dorms includes a pool and a bunch of strange artifacts.
  - The Magister's room at the end of the hall is sealed off.
  - One of the rooms is full of plants, and its walls hold paintings of various colors.
  - One of the rooms is made of wood and its inhabitant is very tall.
  - The room at the end appears to be Hearthian! There is some fuel using a design
    that predates Outer Wilds Ventures.
  - The room at the front of the hall is filled with carpet and has a strange symbol
    on the wall.
  - One of the rooms appears Nomaian in origin. It's full of Nomai writing and standard
    Nomai equipment.
  - Magister's Room
  - The hatch can be controlled from within the Magister's room.
  - I found a hidden vent that leads from the room full of paintings to the Magister's
    room.
  - The Magister invited many people from various races to live on his ship to build
    the Device. He built an Immortality Crystal to allow them to live long beyond
    their natural lifespans.
  - The Magister discovered some kind of vortex that told him about the end of the
    universe. He did not believe that the universe had to end, and called this the
    "Lie of the Universe".
