# Outer Wilds XML Tools

A suite of tools for creating Dialogue, Nomai Text, and Ship Log XML files for use with [New Horizons](https://nh.outerwildsmods.com/index.html). There is also limited JSON support. This toolset is designed to be used in a Unity project. 

**THIS TOOLSET IS IN ALPHA TESTING.** While I believe all the created features should work as expected, there is likely to be bugs. I recommend commiting often whenever using this.

For information on how to use this tool, such as installation instructions, refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/GameWyrm/outer-wilds-xml-tools/wiki).
